# Semi-Supervised learning for Face Anti-Spoofing using Apex frame

## Face Anti-Spoofing (FAS) is designed to identify fraudulent attempts aimed at bypassing a face recognition system using counterfeit faces. State-of-the-art FAS techniques either analyze the complete video sequence or a specific segment to enhance model performance. However, their ability to generalize across domains is often hindered by the domain shift problem, arising from variations in distributions between training and testing data. In this study, we develop a generalized FAS method within the semi-supervised learning (SSL) paradigm. We achieve this by creating apex frames derived from a video through a weighted sum of its frames, where the weights are determined using a Gaussian distribution centered around the videoâ€™s central frame. Motivated by this, we generate multiple unlabeled apex frames by exploring different temporal lengths to leverage semi-supervised learning. To further enhance SSL performance, we propose a novel Gaussian-weighted loss function. This function adjusts the pseudo-loss based on confidence scores that have been smoothed with a Gaussian kernel. Our experimental results from four face anti-spoofing databases (CASIA, REPLAY-ATTACK, OULU-NPU, and MSU-MFSD) demonstrate that the proposed apex frames, combined with the semi-supervised mechanism and Gaussian-guided pseudo-loss, enable more confident predictions.
